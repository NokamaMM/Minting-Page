// Many contracts and protocols have mint fees that will not be included in the tokenPrice but must be added to the fully-weighted cost for txns to process. Recommend adding protocol fees to this page & swapping out the array in the lookup function based on contract type.  If your contract does not have a fee, just delete the addition of a fee from The Box's cost property.
